        <p>
            Hi, I'm George Edwards, a game developer with a focus on programming. I have a passion for creating immersive gaming experiences through level design, 3D modeling, and coding. With over 3 years of experience in game development, I specialize in using C# and Unity to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my journey, I have also gained proficiency in other game development frameworks such as Godot and GDscript, additionally I'm currently practicing & learning C++ and Unreal Engine. This versatility allows me to adapt to different project requirements and explore diverse development environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked on a variety of projects, including "Tails of a Cat," a mobile game that was successfully released on the Play Store. Additionally, I have developed "Immersion Sector," a physics-based VR game that showcased my ability to create interactive and engaging experiences, although it wasn't officially released.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am actively involved in "Project Silent," a stylized, first-person horror game set in a haunting hospital environment. I am excited to leverage my skills and expertise to deliver a truly immersive and spine-chilling gaming experience to players.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am continuously seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the game development industry. If you have any inquiries or would like to collaborate on a project, please feel free to get in touch via the contact page.
